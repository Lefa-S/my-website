# 🧠 My Personal Website

Hey there! This is my personal website — a simple space all about me, what I’m working on, and how far I’ve come.

Right now it’s built with just **HTML** and **CSS**, but I’ll be leveling it up with **JavaScript** and **React** as I grow. Think of it like my own little timeline.

## 💻 What's Inside
- A quick intro about me
- A showcase of my first projects
- Clean layout and responsive design (still improving)
- ✨ Custom fonts, gradients, and maybe a GIF or two

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- (React coming soon…)

## 🛠️ How to Run It
1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/Lefa-S/my-website.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
   That’s it — no build steps yet.

## 📅 Future Plans
- Convert to React for components and routing

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
I wanna look back 5–10 years from now and see how I started — raw, unfiltered progress. This site is my digital footprint as I become the dev I’m aiming to be.
